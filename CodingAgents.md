# Title: "Coding Agents and the Next Era"

## Thesis:

Thesis here

## Supporting Clause - "Vibe Coding is a step-change - not a fad."

### Background, definitions, citations:

 - `vibe coding:` Link to X post and/or picture of this defintion by adre karpathy

### Narrative:

This is our argument.

Focus on the "embrace exponentials" part of it.

Code becomes easy-to-make so as to nearly be disposable.

### Refutation: "The usage of AI agents is harmful, to mental health, memory and cognition - esp. for children"

#### Background, definitions, citations:

 - as needed, we can provide further evidence.

 - what we can't do is re-define the above.  Our argument can propose a NEW definition or alteration, but we can't just "over write" it here and make an argument off of it.  We'll need to provide evidence (or point to something), then we can narrate about it below

#### Narrative

> we can quote from the above and reply, as needed.

We can also just talk and make new arguments.


### Reply

This section is our "reply to the refutation."  This section can be used to allow us to list common counter arguments in our "Refutations" section, but then provide logic to redirect our consideration for it.  We don't list evidence here, as all so-called "citations"
