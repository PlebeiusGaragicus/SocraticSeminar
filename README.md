# SocraticSeminar

This project attempts to structure a "socratic seminar" using markdown and python-like class definitions.  See [Socratic Seminar](./SocraticSeminar.md) for our template.  Also, see "Coding Agents and the Next Era.md" as an example

The goal is to create a very clear "template" by which a user can outline a thesis, discovery and/or propose a new algorithm, thought process, methodology, prescription, workout routine, anything!

Real-world students will use this template to learn about argumentation, logical thinking and rhetoric.  It's very similar to teaching them how to write an essay.

Also, application developers can use this to build simple web apps leaverage agentic chat features to enhance clarity of thinking and allow students to practice their rhetoric.

Professionals, just as easily, may use this in their research and to document their thought process for product design.
